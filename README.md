# GG-Network

A web application for gamers who want to connect to other gamers.

Ready up! GG is a social networking app where gamers can post epic gaming moments, news, posts, etc.. This a space just for gaming and gaming related themes. 

## Why?
Gaming has always been part my life and played (no pun intended)  a hugmoinus role in it aswell. While there are other social networks, I realized that many of them have become very crowded with influencers, and ads. This gave me the idea of creeating a social network for me and my friends where we wopuldnt get bombarded with a bunch of random distractions.
